  <h3>{%BMR%}</h3>

   <p><b>FORMULA</b><br><br>
    The Harris-Benedict Equation is often used to estimate basal metabolic rate.
    <br>•Men: BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 x weight in kg) + (4.799 x height in cm) - (5.677 x age in years)
    <br>•Women: BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 x weight in kg) + (3.098 x height in cm) - (4.330 x age in years)

    <br><b>What is Basal Metabolic Rate ? </b><br>
    Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is often used interchangeably with resting metabolic rate (RMR).
     While BMR is a minimum number of calories required for basic functions
      at rest, RMR — also called resting energy expenditure
      (REE) — is the number of calories that your body burns
      while it’s at rest.

    <b><br>Why to know our BMR?</b><br>
    Knowing your Basal Metabolic Rate is important whether you want to
    maintain your weight, lose weight, or even gain weight.
    Your BMR can help determine what number of calories you should be
    eating in order to meet your goals. If you want to lose weight,
    you will need to eat less than your BMR (or maintenance calories).

    <br>
    <b>Importance of BMR </b><br>
    Your BMR can be used to help you gain, lose, or maintain your weight.
     By knowing how many calories you burn, you can know how many to consume.
